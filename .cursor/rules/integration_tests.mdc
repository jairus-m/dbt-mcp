# Integration Tests Use Real HTTP

## Purpose
Ensure integration tests reflect production by issuing real HTTP requests against configured services.

## Standards/Patterns
- Build clients through the standard config providers so they pull credentials and endpoints from the environment.
- Avoid monkeypatching or stubbing `requests`/network calls inside `tests/integration`; rely on unit tests for mocking.
- If request observations are needed, subclass the client to record metadata while still calling the real implementation.
